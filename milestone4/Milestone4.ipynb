Here we are going to create a new endpoint that accepts a POST request of the features required to run the machine learning model that you trained and saved in last milestone (i.e., a user will post the predictions of the 25 climate model rainfall predictions, i.e., features,  needed to predict with your machine learning model).

We'll be using `screen`. `screen` will allow us to create a separate session within which we can run `flask` and which won't shut down when we exit the main shell session. Read [this](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-linux-screen/) to learn more on ```screen```.\n",
    "10. Now, create a new `screen` session (think of this as a new, separate shell), using: `screen -S myapi`. If you want to list already created sessions do ```screen -list```. If you want to get into an existing ```screen -x myapi```.\n",
    "11. Within that session, start up your flask app. You can then exit the session by pressing `Ctrl + A then press D`. Here you are detaching the session, once you log back into EC2 instance you can attach it using ```screen -x myapi```.\n",
    "12. Feel free to exit your connection with the EC2 instance now and try accessing your service again with `curl`. You should find that the service has now persisted!\n",

    "Our week-by-week journey in cloud computing:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Milestone 1:** The journey of DSCI 525 began with much frustration as we learned the difficulties of working with big data using our local machines. Team members were constantly facing memory and resource limitations depending on their set up. Even with clever code implementation to try and maximize efficiency, reading and writing massive csv files was still posing a problem and occasionally crashing our systems. We began to appreciate the effects of more appropriate file types such as parquet and feather files and sophisticated libraries like Dask to drastically cut down on run times. The underlying problem remained however, that we were still working on our personal laptops and constrained by their hardware. Enter the wonderful world of cloud computing where all the CPU power and memory we need would be available.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Milestone 2:** In this milestone, we acquired hands-on experience with building infrastructure in cloud for a scale-up solution. We first set up an EC2 instance and a s3 bucket, followed by basic data wrangling on the EC2 instance with the ease of using s3 as the storage for our large files. Although we found it slightly challenging to connect the setup with the lecture material at the beginning, the idea became clearer as the milestone progressed. This learning experience helped us visualize the power of cloud computing, deepened our understanding of the concepts behind a scale-up solution, and prepared us for the comparison with a scale-out solution in the next milestone.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Milestone 3:** In this milestone, we experienced the process of setting up an EMR cluster with Spark and JupyterHub. Configuring and setting up everything was relatively straightforward and it allowed us to quickly jump into model building without worrying about hardware and software maintenance issues. In milestone 1, we constantly had concerns about our hardware specifications when working with larger sized data, cloud computing by AWS solved this problem by allowing us to easily scale up or out depending on our needs. In addition, as AWS handled most of the underlying big data framework processes, working with big data is now easier than ever!\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Milestone 4:** During the final week, we learned how to take a trained model and deploy it to the cloud. None of our team had much web development experience, so the tasks seemed daunting at first. However, it became clearer as as we tried our hand at getting our week 3 model to work in the cloud. All of us are glad that we can now not only train and run a model locally or on the cloud, but also set up a basic RESTful API to have users or downstream applications interact with these models. This seems like the critical last missing link in allowing our work as future Data Scientists to be shared with others."
